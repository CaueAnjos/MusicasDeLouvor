# MusicasDeLouvor üéµ‚ú®

> *The praise music PowerPoint generator that nobody asked for but everyone secretly needed*

Welcome to the codebase for MusicasDeLouvor‚Äîthe tool for everyone who's ever stared at their music folder and thought, "You know what this needs? More Microsoft Office integration and significantly less manual labor."

This is basically what happens when a developer gets tired of manually copy-pasting lyrics into slides and decides to automate their way out of the problem. Spoiler alert: it works surprisingly well.

## Installation üíæ

**üê£ Noob Mode (Recommended for Humans):**
- Run `dotnet tool install LouvorHelper`
- You'll need the .NET SDK. If you don't have it, congratulations‚Äîyou're about to learn something new today!
- Pro tip: Installing .NET is easier than explaining to the pastor why the lyrics are Comic Sans again

**üòé Intermediate Mode (For People Who Read Instructions):**
- Download the latest release from our releases page
- Extract the zip file (yes, you need to actually unzip it‚Äîthis isn't 1995)
- Put it somewhere your computer can find it (preferably not in your Downloads folder with the other 847 files)
- Add it to your PATH and feel like a legitimate programmer for 5 minutes

**ü§ì Hardcore Mode (For Masochists and Nerds):**
- Clone this repo like you're stealing government secrets
- Open `LouvorHelper.sln` and build it yourself like a boss
- If you're reading this section, you probably enjoy fixing things that aren't broken
- When it inevitably doesn't work on first try, remember: it's not a bug, it's a feature üòÅ

## How to Use This Beautiful Tool üî®

This is a CLI tool, which means you get to type commands and pretend you're in The Matrix. Don't worry‚Äîunlike Neo, you won't need to dodge bullets, just occasional compiler errors.

Open your terminal (that scary black window) and type:

```bash
lyric -h
```

Congratulations! You've just executed your first command. Your computer science professor would be so proud (if they knew you finally left the GUI behind).

### The Two Commands That Actually Matter:

**`lyric get`** - The Magic Lyrics Fetcher
- Scrapes lyrics from the internet like a caffeinated spider
- Saves them to your computer in an organized fashion (unlike your actual music library)
- Automatically creates a PowerPoint presentation because apparently everything needs to be a slideshow these days

**`lyric compile`** - The PowerPoint Alchemist
- Takes your saved lyrics and transforms them into presentation gold
- Supports fancy templates so your church slides look less like a 1998 geocities website
- Works approximately 73% of the time, every time

## Frequently Asked Questions (That Nobody Actually Asked) ‚ùì

**Q: Why is this called `lyric`?**
A: Because "SongWordyMcSlideface" was already taken. Also, it processes lyrics. Revolutionary naming, I know.

**Q: Why do I need this tool?**
A: Because you want to keep your musics in a folder and have presentations with all the lyrics ready to go. It's pretty handy if you're the person running slides at church (I'm that guy, by the way). Think of it as your personal assistant for musical PowerPoint chaos.

**Q: Why did you make this a command-line tool?**
A: Because I like using my shell, and GUIs are overrated. But don't worry‚ÄîI'm planning to add a GUI version... someday... maybe... when I feel like it.

**Q: Will this make me better at running church tech?**
A: It won't make you better, but it will make you faster at being mediocre. Sometimes that's enough.

## Final Words üôè

Remember: With great PowerPoint power comes great responsibility. Use this tool wisely, and may your presentations always be slightly less embarrassing than last week's.

*Created by someone who got tired of manually formatting lyrics at 6:47 PM on Sunday nights just because he forgot to do it on Saturday mornings.*

*If this tool crashes during Sunday service, just blame it on "technical difficulties" and sing acapella. People love that authentic worship experience.*
